// About SASS folder architecture:

// The architecture for the project is based on the 7-in-1 Sass architecture
// pattern. https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern

// I've left out the "vendors, themes, and pages folders for now".

// This page is only for importing all other Sass pages. For now, I've just
// added some of the 'typical' import files for now and we can add other files
// as needed. In particular, note the "component" folder. Each React component
// should have an equivalent file in that folder for writing its styles.

// Also worth noting each HTML/JSX element should have a class name, for use
// when referring to that element in CSS later on.
